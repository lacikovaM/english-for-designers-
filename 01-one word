# **One Word** - *brainstorming*
#
##### **Normal**/*normally* ***VS*** **usual**/*usually*
- Normal – out of the norm
- Normally I buy things but today I decide to go somewhere else.
- That not normal – person could use it both a as a derogatory term or as, or when their scared the other person is n doing ca be alarming to their health.
- This usage if word can show a person’s social background – in one social a certain behaviour can be seen as out of the norm in the other it might be alright.
- Before doing this assignment, as it had told us to do – in class I have heard that I was not the only one who thought of this certain word?
- And why is that?
- Connection to mental health
#
##### **Literally**
-	In a literal sense
- In modern slang its used in sentence when the speak does not actually mean it in a literal sense
- Confusing

##### **“like” & stuff** 
- my filler words

##### ***“Girl dinner”***
#
– rather than a single word a phrase and evolution of it – (an internet trend) (ps. My point of view)
– this phrase originated from a video where a person is eating an ice cream. 
– What ppl interpreted, found a common ground in is that sometimes a person wants to have any food juts in a sake of eating something.
– 	Witch kind of branch out to people showing how to make “girl dinner” meaning foods that you can make yourself or just a simple snack.
– Then it evolved into girl lunch and breakfast where again ppl shared their quick recipes. It also inspired people to make educational videos about eating disorders.
– In fandoms it took of meaning of attraction to a certain character 
– Then to make it inclusive for any one it evolved into boy dinner, nonbinary luck etc.

###### *Speaking of inclusion:*
#
– Then it took another spin: The phrase got niche – for fun and learning. 
-	Gay math. – mainly jokes about how the gay (umbrella term) people are just faster getting to place by foot
-	Neurodivergent, ADHD, autism math. – how a brain of   Neurodivergent versus neurotypical person works
-	And very interesting take: nonbinary linguistics (which I saw recently) – where a person teaches about vocabulary that is respectful and inclusive for LGBTQ+ folks.
