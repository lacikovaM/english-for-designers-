### *First Half*

Conforming to things that are expected in society, but if not things are not normal, they are out of that norm. In closed-minded communities of the word this a a huge problem you can be viewed as a sick/ill/ not healthy person and be cast out out to the corner. In creative industries things that are not normal can be viewed as thinking out of the box and those ideas are often praised. There for the usage of this word can show a person’s social background – in one society a certain behaviour can be seen as out of the norm in the other it might be alright It can show what values a certain person or family has.

*“ This ain't normal.”* - a phrase many of us probably heard - but was used in a derogatory tone / or in a caring way? weather way this phrase is used when something is alarming and is contented to health. 	When someone says this is not ok it means this is not healthy there is something wrong or broken and it needs to be fixed. It is not normal = there is something wrong

- normal things are connected to behaviour and patterns in a daily routine 
- comfort zones - how comfortable you are stepping outside the normal
- *“i just want to be normal”* - i just want to be like everybody else - but if everyone was normal and everyone would be the same - with no quietness in the world how would that look  -  VERY BORING AND MONOTONE - AND PREDICTABLE so predictable - normal things are predictable not normal things are not 
- normal things are expected in social events  — great expectations!
